## 4. Development

To set up your environment to develop this CV, run `bundle install`.

Your CV is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your CV, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your site. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your site's contents. As you make modifications to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
